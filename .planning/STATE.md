# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-10)

**Core value:** The gameplay feel — buttery smooth controls, tight timing windows, and satisfying feedback that makes every tap feel perfect.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Core Game Loop

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 10 (Core Game Loop)
Plan: 2 of 5 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-11 — Completed 02-02-PLAN.md

Progress: █████░░░░░ 13%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 7
- Average duration: 11 min
- Total execution time: 1.3 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation | 5/5 | 67 min | 13 min |
| 2. Core Game Loop | 2/5 | 8 min | 4 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-03 (25 min), 01-04 (6 min), 01-05 (5 min), 02-01 (4 min), 02-02 (4 min)
- Trend: Accelerating (Phase 2 plans executing very fast — clean autonomous execution)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 01-01 | Flutter SDK installed to C:/flutter | Was not pre-installed; cloned stable branch |
| 01-01 | Let pub resolve latest Flame versions | Avoid version pinning issues early |
| 01-02 | CameraComponent.withFixedResolution(400x800) via constructor | Cleaner initialization than creating in onLoad |
| 01-02 | GameWidget.controlled(gameFactory:) modern pattern | Avoids deprecated instance passing |
| 01-03 | World-level TapCallbacks instead of game-level | Game-level gives canvas coords not world coords under fixed-resolution camera |
| 01-03 | CircleComponent for TapIndicator | Built-in circle rendering, cleaner than raw PositionComponent |
| 01-04 | Simple enum + methods for game state | No external library needed; sufficient for game flow |
| 01-04 | HUD transparent Stack with Positioned children | Game canvas remains visible and tappable behind HUD |
| 01-05 | GameConfig static const class with private constructor | Simple centralized config, no DI overhead needed |
| 01-05 | Placeholder player/obstacle values in GameConfig | Will be tuned in Phase 2-3 when features exist |
| 02-01 | Diamond/rhombus shape via canvas.drawPath | Geometric, game-like aesthetic matching art style |
| 02-01 | MoveEffect.to() with 0.1s for dodge animation | Snappy responsive feel, cancel-before-add pattern |
| 02-02 | Subtract-not-zero timer accumulator | Preserves timing accuracy across variable frame rates |

### Deferred Issues

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Flutter SDK at C:/flutter is not in system PATH — must use full path `C:/flutter/bin/flutter` or add to PATH before sessions
